# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
# https://docs.github.com/zh/actions/

# Sample workflow for building and deploying a site to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy VitePress to Pages

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: 'pages' # 'pages' ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel

  # Build job
