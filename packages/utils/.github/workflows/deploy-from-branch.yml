# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

# Sample workflow for building and deploying a site to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy VitePress from Branch

## Controls when the workflow will run
on:
#  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
#  push:
#    branches: [ "develop" ]
#  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: ci-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }} # ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' }}
